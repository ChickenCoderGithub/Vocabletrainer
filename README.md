Fork info:
Becouse the developing of the app stopped I will try to fix 
the mode where only vocabulary that has a high failure quote will be asked.
In the original app this setting only worked till you restart and not in the training mode.
Now I changed it so it will save the failure quote and also work in the training mode

My time is verry limited so Im not sure when Im able to work at this project.
Status: Done but still have to make this readme looking pretty

Tell me if you got some exported vocabulary according to a book so Im able to upload it to the VocabImport folder
